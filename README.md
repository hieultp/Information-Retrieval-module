# Information Retrieval module

My handmade python module to do a case study I had in university. All of these functions are written to process text so sparse matrix is heavily used in these.

List of functions:

* remove_stopwords
* get_unique_words
* remove_punctuation
* tf
* log_tf
* augmented_tf
* idf
* tf_idf
* unit_length_scaling
* sim
